She's Simple, Like Quantum Physics.
Her eye's were never quiet,
of her, the only thing I am sure,
is that the rebel in her, will never die,
she's the type of girl, that if you told not to do something,
she'd do it twice,
and take pictures.
I was constructed for her,
and she was molded for me.
I have a weakness for clever minds,
and honestly,
I never had a chance.
